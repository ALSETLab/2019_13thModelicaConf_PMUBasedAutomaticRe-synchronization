This repository contains an Automatic re-synchronization Controller Model Implementation. These Modelica-compliant models are briefly described in the following paper of the American Modelica Conference 2018:

## How to Simulate it?

In your favorite Modelica tool, e.g. Open Modelica, follow the steps below:
- File/Open `./package.mo`
- Under the main package `Modelica2019Germany_ResynchOperation`, Six subpackages should appear as: (1) `Controls`, (2) `Generators`, (3) `SimulationSetup`, (4) `Essentials`, (5) `PowerFlowData`, (6) `Network`. It is recommended to use the distributed version of OpenIPSL library package (version: 1.0.0) from this repository.
- Under the `Network` subpackage, go to the model `Network_10MW`; the Modelica implementation of the distribution network generator model is shown above including the Automatic Re-synchronization controller.
- Go to the `Simulation` tab of your tool, and click the `Simulate` button.
- The simulaiton results of the transmission and distribution network bus voltages should be similar to the figure shown below:

- You can perform similar simulations of the power system model by making your own changes using other components from the distributed package 'Modelica2018US_IslandedOperationControl.mo'.
